# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created for my assignment. The game allows you to play against the computer in a classic 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Game logs each move to a file

## How to Play
1. Player 1 uses "X" and the computer uses "O".
2. Players take turns selecting a box by entering a number from 1 to 9.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all nine cells are filled without any player getting three in a row, the game ends in a tie.
